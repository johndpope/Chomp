What is CHOMP?

CHOMP is a Higher-Order Messaging library for Cocoa on Mac OS X. It aims to be a robust, complete implementation of HOM that depends on nothing outside of Cocoa.


What is Higher-Order Messaging?

HOM is a technique for writing Objective-C methods which take entire messages as their arguments. It can often be used as a more flexible and easier to use replacement for methods which take selectors. For example, in plain Cocoa, if you had an array of objects and you wanted to send -step to each one, you'd write something like this:

[array makeObjectsPerformSelector:@selector(step)];

With HOM, you can write this:

[[array do] step];

HOM also allows much more, including simultaneous iteration over several arrays and mapping of return values into a new collection. HOM can also be used for other methods that don't involve iteration. See the Documentation.html file for more information on how to use CHOMP.


Why CHOMP?

HOM is an old idea in the Cocoa world, but all existing HOM implementations are either small pieces of a larger framework, or are incomplete. CHOMP aims to be a complete HOM implementation that doesn't have any extra baggage.


How do I use it with my application?

By default, the CHOMP project will build a framework that's fit for embedding inside a Cocoa application. You can create a Copy Files build phase to put Chomp.framework inside the Frameworks folder of your application, #import <Chomp/Chomp.h>, and you're ready to go.
